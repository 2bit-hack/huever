## Usage

Run `make` to generate the executable

```
./huever path/to/image
```

This assumes the terminal you are using supports Truecolor

Alternatively, you could run

```
./huever path/to/image ANSI
```
On terminals that do not support Truecolor
(The color results may be inaccurate because of the limited palette)

Run `make clean` to clean up the executable
